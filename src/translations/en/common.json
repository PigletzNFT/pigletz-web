When you order your 3D-printed piggy bank, the NFT is locked in a Smart Contract. The physical object has an unlock code inside, but you have to break the Piglet to get a hold of the cipher. This ensures the item functions in only one reality at a given point in time, always retaining its NFT characteristics.",
