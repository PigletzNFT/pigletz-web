We have created 12345 unique Limited Edition Piglets (also referred to as Pigletz) with provable random characteristics of various rarity. The Piglets are non fungible tokens (NFT). They also have the following features: </p> <h3>1. The Piglets are mining a token</h3> <p> Each Piglet is mining a certain amount of PiFi tokens daily, starting on the day it is minted i.e. at the point of purchase. </p> <h3>2. The Piglets serve as an ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens digital piggy bank</h3> <p> The mined PiFi tokens are deposited into the Piglet. You may also deposit additional ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens. The tokens may be withdrawn only when you destroy the NFT (break the piggy bank). </p> <h3>3. Levels</h3> <p> Each Piglet starts at Level 1 when minted. Based on the amount of PiFi tokens it has accumulated, it may level up. There are a total of three levels. With each next Level, more features of the NFT are revealed. All traits for a Piglet are revealed at Level 3. </p> <h3>4. Boosters</h3> <p> There are various Boosters, that affect the base mining rate of the Piglet by increasing it with a certain percentage. There may be multiple boosters, activated for a Piglet. If that is the case, then all percentages are accumulated. </p> <h3>5. NFT to Physical Object</h3> <p> As soon as a Piglet reaches Level 3, it may be ordered as a 3D-printed physical piggy bank. This locks the NFT in a smart contract and it may not be transferred in the blockchain. This ensures that the NFT exists in only one reality at the same time, retaining the NFT characteristics. When existing as a physical object, the Piglet is mining PiFi tokens with the highest base mining rate. </p> <h3>6. Physical Object to NFT </h3> <p> Inside of each physical 3D-printed Piglet is a code, that allows the user to unlock the NFT in the blockchain. The user must break the physical piggy bank and acquire the code to unlock the NFT using the App. </p> <h2>ii. App</h2> <p> A. The App (also dApp or Decentralized App) facilitates your interaction with the Piglets. To most easily use the App, you must first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser) and an non-custodial electronic wallet compatible with the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard on the Binance smart chain network, such as MetaMask, MathWallet, Trust Wallet and SafePal electronic wallets. Such electronic wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using the Binance Smart Chain network. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask, or other Binance Smart Chain network compatible wallets. </p> <p> B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Binance Smart Chain network. You understand that your Binance public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App. </p> <p> C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Binance, Google Chrome, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties. </p> <p> D. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information. You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Binance wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at info@pigletz.com </p> <h2>iii. External Non-Custodial Wallet</h2> <p> You may choose to associate a non-custodial wallet (by way of example, a MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet) (“External Non-Custodial Wallet”) with your Account. External Non-Custodial Wallets allow you to purchase, store and engage in transactions using the interface provided by the NFT Platform. Associating an External Non-Custodial Wallet, or a specific type thereof (e.g., a MetaMask wallet) may be required as a condition to receiving an NFT, as provided in the specific terms and conditions of an individual drop. By using an External Non-Custodial Wallet in connection with the App, you agree that you are using such External Non-Custodial Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable providers of such External Non-Custodial Wallet. For example, for the MetaMask wallet, those terms and conditions are available at https://metamask.io/terms.html. External Non-Custodial Wallets are not associated with, maintained by, supported by, or affiliated with The Companies. The Companies reserve the right to refuse to associate an External Non-Custodial Wallet with a User’s Account in its sole and exclusive discretion. If you attempt to associate your Account with an External Non-Custodial Wallet bearing risk factors, such attempts may result in the suspension or termination of your Account, each as determined in Companies ' sole and exclusive discretion. The Companies accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of an External Non-Custodial Wallet, and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the App will operate with any specific External Non-Custodial Wallet. The private keys necessary to decrypt an External Non-Custodial Wallet are held solely by you, and not by the Companies. The Companies have no ability to help you access or recover your private keys for your External Non-Custodial Wallet, so please keep them in a safe place. </p> <h2>iv. Wallet Transfers</h2> <p> We may, but have no obligation to, provide functionalities via the App whereby you can transfer items from one wallet to another, such as from your Pigletz Wallet to other wallets such as External Non-Custodial Wallets. Transfers and other transactions between the App and External Non-Custodial Wallets may be facilitated by one or more smart contracts that we have not developed and does not control. You acknowledge the risk of smart contracts and agree to be bound by the outcome of any smart contract operation that you initiate or that is initiated at your direction.
